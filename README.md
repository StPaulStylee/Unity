# Unity
I am learning Game Development using Unity! This shit is for real this time. I've got resources that I like and in an accessible language like C#.

### What is the repo?
I am going through a "mini-diploma" program from Zenva Academy. This repo is is here as a way to track my progress and to show the outside world that I am dedicated to life long learning.

### What's in here??

##### Platformer Prototype
This is where I am currently. This is a game that allows me to implement the basics in Materials, Prefabs, Scripting, etc. I'll update as I progress through this game and the course in general.
